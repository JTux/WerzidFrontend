  <h3>Hoosier Made Toy Co.</h3>
  <p class="subcontent">I was inspired to create this one of kind toy company, and one of a kind toy, almost
    mythically. One day it was just all there and the stars aligned. I can’t fully explain – but from a friend’s post
    about crocheted toys and a dream of providing a fun, meaningful and engaging job opportunity to disabled Hoosiers –
    was born Hoosier Made Toy Co and our Werzid.</p>

  <p class="subcontent">As a kid who was a regular in a resource classroom, to working with disabled Hoosiers in high
    school and, as an instructional aide in my 20’s, this community near and dear to my heart. I’ve always felt that
    these individuals were an untapped asset in our community and job statistics show that many capable, willing, and
    hard working individuals are without employment. Hoosier Made Toys wants to change that by providing an adaptive,
    flexible, fun, and enriching workplace environment.</p>
