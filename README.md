# About

 This 7-inch tall fleece oddity is anything you want it to be! It's handcrafted construction is a rewarding job to those under-represented in the work place. It's a gift, it's an inspiration for the child in you or the child in your life.

Intended for open ended, imaginative play, the Werzid has no rules. It can come to a tea party in the morning, a game of “kick” after lunch and then be ready for bed time snuggles. It’s a pony, a shark, a dinosaur, a bug, a friend... It’s undefined and perfectly intentional.
